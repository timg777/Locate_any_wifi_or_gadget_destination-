# Locate_any_wifi_or_gadget_destination!

 You can track your target wherever and whenever you want!
 
 I used old Moscow's metro bug in this script.
 
 Before running next command you must install webdriver via https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ !
 
# How to use?
 
run:

        python3 locate.py

Then you need to know target's BSSID or MAC address.

If you know, just enter it!

If not yet, just install mac port and enter:

        airport -s
        
to see all wifi in your available range.

Then choose your target BSSID and enter in my script (if you run).

THanks for using!

Enjoy!
